## Functions
Within this template we demonstrate different functions that we use within shiny applications: <br><br> <b>1) Process Modal</b> <br> A modal that we can use to display the session is busy to prevent inputs, especially useful when combined with promises. <br><br><b>2) Scrollable Box</b><br>A box that scrolls to the content within and the height specified within the box definition  <br><br><b>3) Jumbotron Splash Screen</b><br> We have adapted the jumbotron class within Bootstrap to enable us to use and image within and place a colour overlay on the image <br><br><b>4) Dropdown header</b><br> This dropdown allows us to place only a secondary menu in the top right of the dashboard. It can be used for anything however we use it to display user information and links to shared locations. <br><br><b>5) Read git logs</b><br> We pull commit message from the project\'s git and looking for particular tags we create a version number and version details. This is particularly useful when testing as we know the version that is being used and allows us to define version changes easily.
